## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change. Responsibility is a reason for a change.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

A software artifacts should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle

You should be able to substitute a parent type with a subtype.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principal

A client (class that use another class or interface) should not depend on a method that does not use.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

- A high-level concrete class should not depend on a low-level
  concrete class. Instead, both should depend on abstraction.
- Abstraction should not depend upon details. Instead, the details
  should depend upon abstraction.
